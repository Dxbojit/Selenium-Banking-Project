Feature: Transactions Page Functionality
  As a user
  I want to search, filter, and export transactions
  So that I can manage and analyze transaction records efficiently

  Background:
    Given the user is logged into the application
    And the user is on the "Transactions" page

  @Search
  Scenario: TC_TRFR_01 - Search for a specific transaction by Transaction ID
    When the user enters a valid Transaction ID in the search input field
    And the user clicks the "Search" button
    Then the transaction table should display only the record matching that Transaction ID

  @Filter
  Scenario: TC_TRFR_02 - Filter transactions by status
    When the user opens the "Status" filter dropdown
    And the user selects "Completed"
    And the user clicks the "Apply" button
    Then only transactions with status "Completed" should be displayed in the table

  @Filter
  Scenario: TC_TRFR_03 - Filter transactions by date range
    When the user selects a Start Date and an End Date from the date picker
    And the user clicks the "Filter" button
    Then only transactions within the selected date range should be displayed in the table

  @Export
  Scenario: TC_TRFR_04 - Export transaction report to CSV
    When the user clicks the "Export" button
    And the user selects "CSV" as the export format
    Then a file named "Transactions_Report.csv" should be downloaded
    And the file should contain the same data as currently shown in the transaction table
